#this script will run EP-IS, following Barthelme and Chopin, for a simple example:
#standard neutral model with recombination, so 2 parameters theta and rho.
#because the possible values for theta and rho are bounded by zero, and since 
#everything is assuming a Gaussian distribution (posteriors and priors) it seems 
#natural to work on the log scale (natural logs rather than log10). 

#the 'cavity distribution' can be thought of as the estimate of the prior for a particular locus,
#when using all the other data. 

#Initialise things:
Niter = 50 #this is the number of sweeps through the loci 
Npara = 3 #log(theta), log(R), log(tf), 

Nloci = 10 #in this example (but the file contains 100)
#check this is not greater than number in simulated set
if(Nloci > nsim_loci)stop("Nloci > nsim_loci")
nisamp = 4
numnit = 50000 #number of IS simulations
#we build up the posterior for theta and rho by initially starting with the prior then 
#getting the posterior for one locus, then using this as the prior for the next locus
#etc. We then refine the posterior in the subsequent sweeps through the data. 
#first we set the natural parameters all to be zero. This is equivalent to infinite variance
#This is OK, because then the only info comes from the prior, and we build things up
#sequentially from there. 

#set priors.

		# In normal EP, each locus has its own posterior approximation - the overall posterior distribution is 
		# given as the product of a set of multivariate normals, one for each locus. The parameters of this
		# distribution is simply the sum of the natural parameters for each locus-specific distribution. So
		# in standard EP we create the cavity distribution for a particular locus by taking the natural parameters
		# for the current approximation to the posterior (without the prior) (i.e. SigmaInv.mu.sum and SigmaInv.sum) and subtract out
		# the natural parameter values for the current locus. Below, instead, what we are implicitly assuming is
		# that each locus contributes equally to the posterior, so we can obtain the natural parameter for the 
		# cavity distribution by multiplying the current posterior (without prior) by (Nloci -1)/Nloci. This has significant advantages
		# when we are getting noisy estimates for the mean and covariance because otherwise sometimes we can get negative
		# natural parameters (not allowed) for the locus specific posterior approximation. 
		# BTW The '(without the prior)' term in the explanations refers to the fact that I keep the prior natural paramters
		# separate in the average-EP calculation, and just put them in when we are computing the cavity distribution and 
		# in presenting the final results.
